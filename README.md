## My process
 I first added semantic HTML elements to the HTML file. I started by thinking about how I wanted the design to look and function. I knew that I wanted the display to change from rows to columns
depending on the size of the viewport. Although I could have just as easily done this with only flex or only grid, I decided to implement both. I decided that a combination of grid and flexbox would make a really powerful combination. After adding styling to element each individual element as needed, I wrapped them in a grid-container, while making each vehicle section a flex-parent. The grid container made it very easy to shift between rows and columns, while flex made it extremely easy to format the content within each section.

While coding the design, I kept in mind mobile view first and also that browsers already have some responsiveness built into it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I practiced a little bit of BEM and learned a little bit more about it.


### Continued development

I actually found this design to be the simplest of everything I have done so far with Frontend Mentor. I had done something similar for school previously, so it came to me relatively easy and there was very little manipulation of each element. I will continue working from a mobile first approach.
